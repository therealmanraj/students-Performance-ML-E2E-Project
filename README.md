## How to Run üõ†Ô∏è

Follow the steps below to clone, set up, and run the project.

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/therealmanraj/students-Performance-ML-E2E-Project.git
cd students-Performance-ML-E2E-Project
```

---

### **Step 2: Set Up the Environment**

#### For Mac/Linux (Python 3.11+ Recommended):

Ensure you have Python installed. Use `python3` and `pip3`.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Verify the Python version
python --version
```

#### For Windows:

Use the same steps but replace the activation command with:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **Step 3: Install Requirements**

Install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **Step 4: Configure CI/CD (Optional)**

1. Update **GitHub Actions** workflow with your cloud credentials.
2. Push your changes to trigger automated testing and deployment.

---

### **Step 5: Run the Project**

You can execute the pipeline using the main script.

```bash
python main.py
```

---

### **Step 6: Access Local Deployment**

The project runs a server locally. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
